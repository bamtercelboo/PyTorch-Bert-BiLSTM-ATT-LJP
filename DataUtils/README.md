# ***Chinese-NER Task DataUtils*** #


## Role of document in `DataUtils` directory ##

-  	`Alphabet.py`  ------ Build vocab by train data or dev/test data

-	`  Batch_Iterator.py` ------ Build batch and iterator for train/dev/test data, get train/dev/test iterator

-	` Common.py` ------ The file contains some common attribute, like random seeds, padding, unk and others

-  	`Instance.py` ------ It is a instance file to storage data that you read from train/dev/test file

-  	`eval.py` ------ The file is a eval script, For calculate F-score, recall, precision. And decode model result for NERï¼Œsupport `BMES, BIO`  label.(Reference: https://github.com/yunan4nlp)

-  	`eval_bio.py` ------ The role is same with the script of  `eval.py` ,  It is contains `eval_type = exact, binary, propor`, also support ` BMES, BIO`  label.(Reference: https://github.com/Joyce94)

-  	`Load_Pretrained_Embed.py`  ------ Loading Pre-trained word embedding( `glove` or `word2vec` ), now has two way: ose is `oov` (out of vocabulary) use zero word embedding, second is `oov` use average word embedding, will add another one is `oov` use random word embedding.

-  	`Embed_From_Pretrained.py` ------ `nn.Embedding()` from pre-trained word embedding, build a big vocabulary. It can use in `No-Finetune` word embedding.
